# Acoustic Wave Propagation Simulation

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a project developed for the INFO0939 course. It focuses on numerically simulating acoustic wave propagation using finite difference schemes. Implementations include OpenMPI, OpenMP, serial, and GPU acceleration.
The .jobs files are designed to run on the NIC5 and Lucia clusters.
